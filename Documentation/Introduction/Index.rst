The performance of your website is important for several reasons. The most important one is that if a page is to slow
you will lose visitors. Studies showed that over 50% of the people will leave a page that takes longer than three
seconds to load.

As this is important for users, it is important for search engines as well. Search engines want to give the user the
best results possible. If a search engines have to choose between two results that both are interesting for a user, the
fastest one will definitely have a higher change to rank over the other result.
